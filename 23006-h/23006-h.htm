    <p>
      Captain Philo's sail-loft was a pleasant place to sit in, and it was much
      frequented. At one end was a wide, sliding door, that opened on the water,
      and through it you saw the little harbor and the low, glistening sand-bar
      at its entrance, and whitecaps in the sea beyond, and shining sails. At
      the other end another wide door led, by a gently descending cleated
      platform, to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pleasant place to rest and refresh the mind in, whether you chose
      to look in or out. You could rock in the hair-cloth chair by the water
      door, and join in conversation with more active persons mending seines
      upon the wharf; or you could dangle your heels from the work-bench, and
      listen to stories and debates inside, and look on Captain Philo sewing
      upon a mainsail.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a summer afternoon: warm under the silver poplars, hot in the
      store, and hotter in the open street; but in the sail-loft it was cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than once,&rdquo; Captain Bennett was remarking from the rocking-chair,
      while his prunella shoes went up and down,&mdash;&ldquo;more than once I've
      wished that I could freight this loft to Calcutta on speculation, and let
      it out, so much a head, for so long a time, to set in and cool off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about them porious water-jars they hev there?&rdquo; asked Uncle Silas, who
      had never sailed beyond Cape Pogue; &ldquo;how do they work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;they 're so-so. But you set up this loft, both
      doors slid open, air drawing through and all, right on Calcutta main
      street, or what they call the Maiden's Esplanade, and fit it up with
      settees like a conference-meeting, and advertise, and you could let out
      chances to set for twenty cents an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 'd hev to hev a man to take tickets, to the door,&rdquo; said Uncle Silas,
      who had been looking for an easy job for forty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Si all over.&rdquo; said Captain Bennett, with a wink; &ldquo;that berth would
      be just his size.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Uncle Silas, faintly smiling, &ldquo;'t is no use rubbin' the fur
      the wrong way; stroke the world from head to tail is my rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of folks being easy,&rdquo; said Captain Bennett, &ldquo;it seems there 's
      quite a little story about David Prince's voyage on the 'Viola.'&rdquo; &ldquo;I
      thought he went off whaling rather in a hurry,&rdquo; said Captain Philo, &ldquo;and
      if it had been 'most anybody else, I should have thought there was
      something up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; said Captain Bennett, &ldquo;it was like this: You know, Delia was
      n't much over ten years old when her mother died, along a piece after her
      father, and she come to live with us. And you know how she was almost like
      one of the family. Well, about eight years ago, when she 'd got to be
      towards nineteen, it was then that David first set out to shine up to her;
      and when he begun to come home from singing-school with her that winter,
      and got to coming to the house quite often the next spring along, I begun
      to feel a little shaky. Finally, one Sunday afternoon I was sitting out on
      the porch and she was singing hymns inside,&mdash;you know she was always
      singing,&mdash;and I called to her to quit and come out, and sit down
      alongside of me, and says I,&mdash;&ldquo;'Delia, it can't be you 're thinking
      of taking up with David Prince?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she flared a little, but finally says she:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why should n't I, or anybody that has the chance, take David Prince?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well,' says I, 'I don't think you need to ask why; I should say that a
      smart girl wouldn't want more than to travel once along the Lower Road and
      see those two run-down houses,&mdash;one deserted, and the other, handy
      by, about as bad,&mdash;and the barn across the road, that was raised and
      boarded in over forty years ago, and never shingled, and stood so till
      it's all rotted and sunk in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What's that got to do with David?' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It's got this to do with David,' says I, 'that his father and his Uncle
      Ezekiel and their father before 'em&mdash;good, kindly men&mdash;all
      seemed to settle, settle, somehow; and it was all to-morrow, and
      to-morrow, with 'em; 'and then I told Delia how they sold off their wood
      and then their land, piecemeal, all but the spot where the old buildings
      stand,&mdash;and that's worth nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And that's the way,' says I, 'it 'll be with David when he gets over
      being a boy and settles down; it's in the blood; and I don't want to see
      you, Delia, keel-hauled there&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like David's mother,&mdash;Prudence Frost, that was,&rdquo; said Uncle Silas;
      &ldquo;originally she was a good, smart girl, and full of jingle; but finally
      she give up and come to it,&mdash;lef sweepin'-day out o' the almanic,
      washed dishes in cold water, and made up beds at bedtime; and when she
      ironed a shirt, jes' 's like's not she 'd iron a hoss-fly right into the
      bosom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And lived a dog's life generally,&rdquo; said Captain Bennett. &ldquo;So I laid the
      whole thing out to Delia, the best way I knew how.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well,' says she, 'I know you mean my good, Captain Bennett,&mdash;but I
      shall take my chances.' And so she did. Well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speakin' o' the barn,&rdquo; said Uncle Silas, &ldquo;do you remember that high shay
      that David's father hed? I was up to the Widow Pope's vendue the day he
      bid it off. He managed to spunk up so fur's to hitch the shaffs under his
      team and fetch the vehicle home, and then he hed n't no place to put it up
      out o' the weather,&mdash;and so he druv it along under that big Bald'n
      apple-tree that used to stand by the pantry window, on the north side o'
      the house, and left it there, with the shaffs clawin' down in the ground.
      Then the talk was, he was goin' to build him a sort of a little tabernacle
      for it before winter set in; and he hed down a load of lumber from Uncle
      Joe's mill and hed it dumped down alongside o' the shay. But the shay was
      n't never once hitched up, nor the tabernacle built; and the timber and
      the shay jes' set there, side by side, seein' who 'd speak first, for
      twenty year, to my cer-ting knowledge; and you go by there when it was
      blowin' fresh, and the old curtings would be flappin' in and out, black
      and white, till finally the whole arrangement sunk out o' sight. I guess
      there 's more or less wrack there now, 'f you sh'd go poke in the grass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was thirty-one year ago, come October, that he bought the shay,&rdquo; said
      Captain Philo; &ldquo;it was the fall I was cast away on the Tombstones, and
      lost every dollar I had. I remember it because the old man came down to
      the house of his own accord, when I got home, and let me have two hundred
      dollars. He 'd just been selling the West New Field; and when he 'd sold
      land and had money on hand, it was anybody's that wanted it. But what was
      it about David's going off so sudden on the 'Viola'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I forgot my errand,&rdquo; said Captain Bennett; &ldquo;and now I 've got
      adrift in my story, and I shall have to take an observation; let's see,
      where was I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delia allowed she 'd take her chances,&rdquo; said Uncle Silas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Captain Bennett. &ldquo;Well, you know how it was when they got
      married: David fixed the old house up a little, and mother put in some
      furniture and things for her, and all went on first-rate awhile; and then
      you know how David begun to settle, settle, just the old way; could n't
      seem to keep up to the wind; appeared to carry a lee helm, somehow; and
      Delia begun to take in work and go out to work, and quit singing. She
      never said a word, even to my wife; but I could see 't it cut her a good
      deal&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all this time,&rdquo; said Uncle Silas, &ldquo;she 's kep' up smart,&mdash;allers
      hed a high crower's-feather 'n her bunnet, and kep' her little boys
      a-lookin' like nine-shillin' dolls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should n't have ever called David lazy,&rdquo; said Captain Philo. &ldquo;He could
      n't seem to make up his mind what to do next, that 's all; but get him
      going&mdash;you remember how he worked at Jason's fire; and I know of my
      own knowledge he was in the surf for sixteen hours, when that Norwegian
      bark was on the Bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there's some folks,&rdquo; said Uncle Silas, &ldquo;that their mind works all
      the time&mdash;runs a day gang and runs a night gang. You know how a hard
      sum 'll shake itself out in your head overnight; and I think it's the most
      natural thing that a man with a A No. I active mind always should feel
      sort of tired and not know what ails him. George, won't you jes' git up
      and hand me that pipe&mdash;you ain't doin' nothin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However it was,&rdquo; said Captain Bennett, &ldquo;Delia saw that he was drifting to
      leeward, and she was worried. Well, you know when the reformation set in,
      that winter, and run crowded houses,&mdash;one night in the West Church
      and the next in the other. One night David surprised his wife by going;
      and he set in a back seat, and come away and said nothing; and the same
      the next night; and the same for seven or eight nights right along.
      Finally, one night, they had a pretty searching sermon,&mdash;'<i>Choose
      ye this day</i>,' et cetera,&mdash;and I suppose the Deacon, here, was
      rather expecting David to rise for prayers; but, instead of that, as soon
      as Amen was said, he gets right up, and off he goes, and leaves Delia
      there, without saying a word to her or to anybody, and goes right up to
      Captain Westcott's house and agrees to ship. And glad enough Captain W.
      was to have him, and next day off he went. Now here he is, gone two years
      and over, and comes home night before last; his lay 'll figure out five
      hundred dollars; and the biggest thing is&rdquo;&mdash;here the Captain brought
      down his heavy hand, for emphasis, on Uncle Silas's knee&mdash;&ldquo;that Delia
      's kept herself and the children, and never drawn one cent against the
      voyage; so they've got the whole clear, and they 've been up this morning
      early and traded for the Callender place, and they 're going to move in
      to-morrow. And I guess he means business now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they don't git paid off till Monday,&rdquo; said Uncle Silas. &ldquo;They 're all
      goin' up to town to be paid off then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he moves in to-morrow, anyway,&rdquo; said Captain Bennett. &ldquo;Monday
      night, I believe, he's going to pay down what he has, and take a deed, and
      give a mortgage back for the balance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Uncle Silas gravely shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't indorse this runnin' in haste,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never, in all my
      experience, knew a man before to buy real estate without sort of goin' up
      street and talkin' it over, and comparin' notes 'round generally. Now, we
      could have given him points down here about the Callender place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's made a good trade there,&rdquo; said Captain Bennett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That all may be,&rdquo; said Uncle Silas, &ldquo;but it 's the principle, not the
      five cents, I 'm lookin' at. I should have hed more faith in his holdin'
      out if he hed n't jumped quite so quick. 'Slow bind, fast find,' I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Bennett rose, and drew on a grass-cloth coat that showed his
      suspenders through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be on my winding way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But did you hear how close he
      came to never coming back? No? Well, it was like this: It was blowing a
      gale, and considerable sea on, one night when they were rounding Cape Horn
      on the home voyage, and she was pitching pretty bad, and David was out on
      the jib-boom taking in jib, and somehow she pitched with a jerk, so he
      lost his hold and went off, and, as he fell in the dark, naturally he
      struck out both hands, blind, like this; and he just happened to catch, by
      sheer accident, a gasket that was hanging from the jib-boom, and so he
      saved himself by a hair's breadth. And when he came up they thought it was
      his ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I always make it a point to look on the bright side, without
      exception,&rdquo; said Uncle Silas; &ldquo;nevertheless, I prophesy it won't be two
      years before he 'll have the place all eat up, and sold out under the
      mortgage. This jumpin' so quick,&mdash;looks as if he was sca't to trust
      himself for a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall see,&rdquo; said Captain Bennett; &ldquo;time will tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      There are many little farms along the New England sea-board, which the
      currents of life, diverted from ancient channels, have left one side,
      pleasant and homelike often, but of small money value. The Callender place
      was such a farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      It lay a mile from the village, in a hamlet of half-a-dozen dwellings.
      There was a substantial house, with four large rooms below, besides an L
      kitchen, and above, two sunny chambers, each with a dormer and a gable
      window. From the front fence projected, for a hitching-post, a Minerva,
      carved from wood,&mdash;a figure-head washed up years before from the
      wreck of a brig with the bodies of the crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was on a little elevation, and looked across the road, near
      which it stood, and over a sloping field or two, to sea. From the windows
      you could count the sail in the North Channel, and look down the coast and
      follow with the eye the long, low curving line of shore until at Indian
      Point it vanished; or look up shore ten miles to where the coast-line
      ended in a bold, wooded headland, which seemed, by a perpetual mirage, to
      bear foliage so lofty as to show daylight through beneath the branches. At
      night you could see the flash of the revolving light on Windmill Rock, and
      the constant rays from the lightship on the Rips. So that by day or night
      you could never be lonesome, unless, perhaps, on some thick night, when
      you could see no light, and could only hear a grating knell from the
      bell-buoy, and could seem to see, through the white darkness, the waters
      washing over its swaying barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a good-sized boarded barn, well shingled on the roof, with
      hay-mows, and with room for two or three cows and a horse and a wagon, and
      with wide doors &ldquo;fore and aft,&rdquo; as the neighbors put it; through its big
      front door you could look out to sea. Then there were twenty acres of
      land, including a wood-lot which could be thinned out every year to give
      one all his fire-wood, and what was cut would hardly be missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the place which, on the death of the Widow Callender, had been
      offered for sale for eight hundred dollars. For months it had stood empty,
      stormed by all the sea-winds, lit up by the sun, when at last an
      unexpected buyer had turned up in David Prince.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      It was a happy Sunday that he passed with his little family at the new
      home. They went all over the house again and again, and looked from every
      window, and planned where flower-frames should be put, to take the sun.
      Then, going out of doors, they inspected the revolving clothes-dryer,
      which David, with a seaman's instinct, had already rigged with four little
      sloops to sail about on the ends of the projecting arms, on Mondays,
      tacking after shirts and stockings. Then they went to the barn, and David
      showed how he was going to cover the sides with spruce shingles, so that
      he could have a warm place to work in in the winter. Then they went over
      the fields, and planned a garden for the next spring; and then they went
      down to the shore, and, where a little arm of the sea made in, David
      showed where he would haul up his dory, and would keep his boat, when he
      could afford to get one together: in the mean time he was going to fish on
      shares with Jacob Foster, who lived a few rods up the road. Then they all
      strolled back to the house, and dined on shore-birds shot on Saturday
      afternoon, and new potatoes and turnips which Jacob Foster had brought in.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, they all sat at the front windows, in the room which they
      were pleased to call the parlor, David holding on his knees the two oldest
      boys, delighted with the recovery of such a Sindbad of a father, while the
      third, still a little shy of him, stood by his mother. David told of the
      voyage, repeating, by request, full half-a-dozen times, the story of the
      night when he was snapped off the end of the jib-boom; to do which he had
      to set the boys down and stand, to make the swift, sudden clutch, with his
      eyes shut, at the towing rope; at which the boys screamed on every
      repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper, David and his wife, leaving the children with orders to go
      to bed at the first flash from the Windmill, went to church.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took the same back seat which they had the night that David shipped.
      There was much the same scene before them. There was bald-headed Deacon
      Luce, in his usual Damocles' seat exactly beneath the dangling chandelier,
      which children watched in morbid hope of a horror; there was the president
      of the Dorcas Society, a gray-haired woman who had navigated home a
      full-rigged ship from the Gold Coast; there were grave-faced men who,
      among them, could have charted half the globe. In the pulpit was the same
      old-fashioned, bookish man, who, having led his college class, had passed
      his life in this unknown parish, lost in delight, in his study, in the
      great Athenian's handling of the presumptuous Glaucon, or simply unfolding
      parables in his pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      That former night came vividly back to Delia Prince. Through the opening
      hymn, in which she did not join; through the story of the feast in Simon's
      house, she was thinking of the time when David told her he had shipped,
      and she had made up her mind to save a home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the second hymn she joined; and in her joy she forgot herself and
      sang,&mdash;as she had been used to sing when she was the leader of all
      the singing. In a moment they all knew that she was there.
    </p>

     Thus far His power prolongs my days;
     And every evening shall make known
     Some fresh memorial of His grace.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Isaacs&rdquo; was over the door; Mr. Isaacs was within. Without, three
      golden balls were hanging, like apples of the Hesperides; within was an
      array of goods which the three balls had brought in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Isaacs was walking to and fro behind the counter, and briskly rubbing
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good wife Sarah,&rdquo; he said, with a strong Semitic accent, &ldquo;those
      sudden, raw east winds! I am so frozen as if I was enjoying myself upon
      the skating-rink,&mdash;and here it is the summer. Where is that long
      spring overcoat that German man hypotecated with us last evening? Between
      the saddle and the gold-lace uniform, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And taking it down, by means of a long, hooked pole, he put it on. It
      covered his ears and swept the ground: &ldquo;It make me look like Aaron in
      those pictures,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been a grasping disposition that could not be suited with
      something from out Mr. Isaacs's stock. It would have been hard to name a
      faculty of the human soul or a member of the human body to which it could
      not lend aid and comfort. One musically inclined could draw the wailing
      bow or sway the accordion; pucker at the pensive flute, or beat the
      martial, soul-arousing drum. One stripped, as it were, on his way to
      Jericho, could slink in here and select for himself a fig-leaf from a
      whole Eden of cut-away coats and wide-checkered trousers, all fitting &ldquo;to
      surprise yourself,&rdquo; and could be quite sure of finding a pair of boots, of
      whatever size was needed, of the very finest custom hand work,&mdash;a
      misfit, made for a gentleman in New York. A devout man, according to his
      leanings, could pray from the prayer-book of an impoverished Episcopalian,
      or sing from the hymn-book of an insolvent Baptist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So help me gracious!&rdquo; Mr. Isaacs used to say, raising his shoulders and
      opening wide his palms; &ldquo;when you find a man so ungrateful that he cannot
      be fitted out with somethings from my stock, I really suppose you could
      not fit that man out in Paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Isaacs was looking nervous. But it was not by the images which his
      ordinary stock in trade would naturally cause to arise that he was
      disturbed,&mdash;images though they were of folly, improvidence, and
      distress. There was indeed hardly an article in the shop, except the new
      plated jewelry in the window, that was not suggestive of misery or of sin.
      But in Mr. Isaacs's well-poised mind no morbid fancies arose. &ldquo;Those hard
      winters makes me cheerful,&rdquo; he was wont to say in the fall; &ldquo;they makes
      the business lifely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still, Mr. Isaacs was a little troubled this afternoon, and, singularly
      enough, about a most happy purchase that he had just made, at ninety per
      cent below value. There the articles lay upon the counter,&mdash;a silk
      hat, a long surtout, a gold-headed cane and a pair of large rubbers; a
      young man's Derby hat and overcoat and rattan cane, and a pair of arctics;
      a lady's bonnet and dolman and arctics; a young girl's hat with a soft
      bird's-breast, and her seal-skin sack and arctics; besides four small
      boys' hats and coats and arctics. It seemed as if some modern Elijah, a
      family man, expectant of translation, had made with thrifty forethought an
      &ldquo;arrangement&rdquo; that Mr. Isaacs's shop should be the point of departure, and
      flying off in joyous haste, with wife and children, had left the general
      raiment on the counter. You would naturally have looked for a sky-lit hole
      in the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So help me gracious!&rdquo; said Mr. Isaacs, turning the articles over; &ldquo;I
      suppose there 's some policemen just so wicked and soospicious to say I
      must know those garments are stolen&mdash;scooped off some hat-tree, the
      last winter, at one grab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you enter dose on de book to-gedder?&rdquo; said Mrs. Isaacs. &ldquo;If you
      put dose separate on de book, how de policeman know dey came in togedder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a great danger, Sarah. That's just the way they fix our good
      friend Greenbaum. When they caught the thief, and he tell them where he
      sell some things, and Greenbaum had put down those earrings and those
      bracelets and that Balmoral skirt for three different times, they say he
      must know those things was stolen,&mdash;if not, why did he put those
      things down different from each other?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But so help me gracious!&rdquo; he added, presently, &ldquo;I have not the least
      soospicions, like the babes unborn, those goods are stolen. The man that
      brought them in was very frank, and very much of a gentleman; and he lay
      his hand upon his bosom-pin, and swear he sell those things because he has
      no more use for them,&mdash;his family all sick of tyvoid fever, and
      cannot live the week out. But I suppose there's some policemen just so
      soospicious to say I must know those things are stolen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so cruel soospicions,&rdquo; said Mrs. Isaacs,&mdash;&ldquo;and your heart so
      pure and white like your shirt-bosom.&rdquo; She meant his ideal shirt-bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just like those evil-minded policemen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You remember how they
      lock up our old friend Abrahamson? So help me gracious! sent that good old
      man to prison, just because he buy two gold watches and two pairs of gold
      spectacles and an ivory-handled knife and two empty pocket-books and two
      silk umbrellas and a seal ring and two bunches of keys and two black wigs
      from a red-headed laboring man; they say he must know that two old
      gentlemen were robbed of that personal property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But here his attention was diverted by the sight of two men, seamen to
      appearance, who were looking into the show-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like so much,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to see the public enjoying themselves in my
      window; it give them so happy pleasure to see those lovely things; and
      often they comes in and buy somethings. This young man,&rdquo; he added, after a
      pause, &ldquo;seem to admire those broad neck-wear; he look at both those two,&mdash;the
      Four-in-hand and the Frolic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he look most at de Frolic,&rdquo; said Mrs. Isaacs; &ldquo;I think he would
      come in if you go outside and take him by de arm like a true frient, and
      bring him in. My broder Moses walk outside de whole day long, and take
      each man when he go by and talk to him like his own broder, wid tears in
      his eyes, and make dem come in and buy somedings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Isaacs only wrapped the long coat more closely about his linen
      garments, and watched the younger man as he turned his eyes away from the
      Four-in-hand and the Frolic and bent them on the trays in which were
      glittering tiers of rings and pins, and rows of watches labelled
      &ldquo;Warranted genuine, $14;&rdquo; &ldquo;Dirt-cheap, $8.75;&rdquo; &ldquo;Doct's Watch,
      Puls-counting, $19.50.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He look like he had some money,&rdquo; said Mrs. Isaacs. &ldquo;Perhaps he would come
      in and buy a watch if you go out and pull him in. How can he buy someding
      through de glass? My broder Moses say, 'So many folks is bashful.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at last the men, after talking awhile, apparently of the goods in the
      window, came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the price of some of those ear-rings in the window?&rdquo; said the
      younger. &ldquo;Let's see what you've got for a couple of dollars or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So help me gracious!&rdquo; said Mr. Isaacs, as he took from the show-window
      three or four cards of plated ear-rings. &ldquo;I knew you would come in to buy
      somethings. When I saw you look in&mdash;the very first moment&mdash;I say
      to my wife, 'There is a good young man that will give a present to some
      lovely young lady.' Yes, sir, the very words I said to Sarah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the price of this pair? I haven't got any girl to treat, but I 've
      just got paid off for a whaling voyage, and my lay figured up a
      twenty-dollar bill above what I expected, and I don't care if I do lay out
      a couple of dollars on my wife besides what I 've brought home for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Isaacs, &ldquo;the good wife is the very best jewelry.
      Those are two dollars. But only study this pair. Hold those up to the
      light and take a bird's-eye view through those lovely stones, so round and
      large like green peas. Now look. So! Now let your friend look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'm no judge,&rdquo; said the other man, &ldquo;I know what pleases me&mdash;that's
      all. But them would make a great display, David, wouldn't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 're right, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Isaacs. &ldquo;'Display' is the very word. My
      wife wear just the twins of this pair to the congregation, every week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Isaacs raised her eyebrows: she wore nothing but diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the price of these green ones?&rdquo; asked David.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Isaacs shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose those are the finest articles of the kind in the whole
      creation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can let you have those to-day,&rdquo; and he lowered his
      voice to a whisper, and put his hand up beside his mouth, &ldquo;to close out
      stock&mdash;for six dollars. They cost us only last week eight-fifty, but
      we are obliged to reduce stock prior to removal. The building is to be
      taken down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like those tip-top; but I don't know&mdash;it's a good deal of
      money for gewgaws; my wife would take me to do for it; I guess I must keep
      to the two-dollar ones. I come pretty hard by my dollars, and a dollar
      means a good deal to me just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But just once look again,&rdquo; said Mr. Isaacs, and he stepped briskly behind
      his wife and held up an ear-ring to each of her ears. &ldquo;See them on a
      chaste and lovely form. With these your wife will be still more lovely.
      All those other men will say, 'Where did that graceful lady find so rich
      ear-rings?' You will see they are a great success: her most bosom friends
      will hate her; they will turn so green like the grass on the ground with
      envy. It is a great pleasure when my wife wears those kind: her very
      sisters cannot speak for anger, and her own mother looks so rigid like the
      Cardiff Giant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess I shall have to take them,&rdquo; said David, &ldquo;and you 'll have
      to wrap them right up: we have n't got more than about time to get the
      train, have we, Calvin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So help me gracious!&rdquo; said Mr. Isaacs, &ldquo;is there no time to sell our
      friend Calvin a pair? He will repent not to secure those other pair, until
      his dying day; so sorry like he lose his ship some day upon those rocks. I
      suppose there is no others like those in the whole creation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he wrapped the purchase up in a bit of white paper and gave David
      Prince four trade dollars in change for a ten-dollar bill, and the two men
      went out, leaving Mr. Isaacs free to attend to a timid woman in black who
      had just come in to raise fifty cents upon a ring, while Mrs. Isaacs
      looked after a carpenter who proposed to pawn his edge-tools for
      rent-money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Isaacs waved his hand and smiled as the men went out of the door. &ldquo;You
      will find they are a success, to surprise yourself,&rdquo; he called out: &ldquo;her
      most bosom friends will writhe and scream with envy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The winding line of the long New England coast faces the sea, in its
      sweeping curves, in every direction. From the Callender place, the ocean
      lay to the south. Though elsewhere east winds might be blowing harsh upon
      the coast, here, almost every day, and all day long, in summer, the
      southwest wind came pouring in from the expanse of waters, fresh and cool,
      boisterous often, but never chill; and even winds from the east lost edge
      in crossing miles of pitch-pine woods, of planted fields, of sandy ponds,
      of pastures, and came in softened down and friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gentle breeze was drifting in from sea. All day long it had been
      blowing, salt and strong and riotous, tossing the pine-tops, bending the
      corn, swaying the trees in the orchards, but now it was preparing to die
      away, as was its wont, at sundown, to give to the woods, the cornfields
      and the orchards a little space of rest and peace before it should rise
      again in the early evening to toss them all night long. The blue of the
      sky was blue in the water. Every object stood out sharp and clear. Down
      the low, curving shore-line, curls of smoke rose from distant roofs, and
      on the headland, up the coast, the fairy forest in the air was outlined
      with precision. Distant ships were moving, like still pictures, on the
      horizon, as if that spell were laid on them which hushed the enchanted
      palace. There was just sea enough to roll the bell-buoy gently, and now
      and then was rung an idle note of warning. Three fishing-boats lay
      anchored off the Spindle, rising and falling, and every now and then a sea
      broke on the rock. On the white sand beach, waves were rolling in, dying
      softly away along the shore, or heavily breaking, with a long, flying line
      of foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was fast descending. Delia Prince went out to the corner of the
      house and shaded her eyes to look at the sunset. The white clouds turned
      to a flaming red, and the reflection dyed to crimson the surface of the
      creeks; the sun descended toward the wooded bluff that flanked the bay,
      sent a thousand shattered, dazzling rays through the trees, and
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red of the clouds and the red of the water gave place to gray. The
      wind died down. The silence was intense,&mdash;all the more marked because
      of the few sharp sounds that broke it now and then. Across the bay, near
      shore, a man was raking oysters; he stood in the stern of his skiff, and
      the bow was up in the air. Near by a girl was driving sluggish cows along
      the beach, and her shrill cries came over the water; by a cottage on the
      bank a boy was chopping brush upon a block, and Delia watched the silent
      blows, and heard the sound come after. He smiled as she looked; for every
      night she saw the boy's mother stand at the door to call him, and saw him
      come reluctant to his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sense of friendly companionship in all these homely sights and
      sounds. It was different from the old house, shut in close by a second
      growth of birch and oak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table was standing ready for a late supper. The children had gone for
      berries to the Island, and they would soon come home, and David was due,
      too, with his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled as he appeared. The ascent to the brow of the hill was so sharp
      that first you saw a hat in movement, then a head, then shoulders, body,
      legs, and feet. She ran quickly down the road to meet him, and took his
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn't catch the noon train?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Captain Wells stopped at
      the door a little while ago to see what time we should be down to get the
      deed, and luckily I told him that we might not be down until into the
      evening. He said he 'd stay at home and wait till we came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delia,&rdquo; said David, when he had seated himself in the house, &ldquo;I 've got
      bad news to tell you, and I may as well out with it first as last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have n't shipped for another whaling voyage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that would be nothing,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delia stood and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;didn't you get as much as you counted on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;twenty more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't anything about the children? I expect them home every minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you was a great fool ever to have me. You ought to have
      taken advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why don't you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 've lost the money,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Captain warned me how apt a
      seafaring man is to lose money; but I did n't take any heed, and I went
      off with Calvin Green&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Calvin Green! What did I tell you!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute&mdash;and I stopped into a jewelry store and bought you a
      pair of ear-rings, and I came off and left my wallet on the counter, the
      way that fool Joe Bassett did, to Gloucester. When I went back, the rascal
      claimed he never saw me before&mdash;said he didn't know me from the
      Prophet Samuel, as if I was born that minute. And now they'll all say&mdash;and
      it's true&mdash;that I'm a chip of the old block, and that I 'm bound to
      come out at the little end. There!&rdquo; he said, as he opened a little parcel
      and took out the earrings. &ldquo;There 's what 's left of five hundred and
      twenty dollars, and you must make the most of 'em. Hold 'em up to the
      light and see how handsome they are. I don't know, after all, but they are
      worth while for a man to pitch overboard off Cape Horn and harpoon whales
      two years for. All is, just tell folks they cost five hundred dollars, and
      they 'll be just as good as hen's-egg diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, I don't know but I sort o' like the situation,&rdquo; he went on, in a
      moment. &ldquo;It seems sort of natural and home-like. I should have felt
      homesick if I 'd really succeeded in getting this place paid for. 'T would
      have seemed like getting proud, and going back on my own relations. And
      then it 'll please everybody to say, 'I told you so.' There 'll be high
      sport round town, when it gets out, and we back water down to the old
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, say something, Delia!&rdquo; he said, in a moment. &ldquo;Why don't you say
      something about it? Don't you care that the money's lost, that you stand
      there and don't say a word, and look at nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to say anything now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Captain Bennett, the next day, to his wife, &ldquo;Delia 's got
      more spunk! I should have felt like laying right down in the shafts, in
      her place; but instead of that, to actually go and talk them into letting
      her keep the Cal-lender place and pay for it so much a month! And David's
      signed a paper to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess if the truth was known,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennett, knitting on, &ldquo;that,
      come to think it over, she was more scared of David's settling back than
      she was for losing the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She 's got a pull on him now,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;anyway, for if he once
      agrees to a thing he always does it.&rdquo;

      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      No one fully knows the New England autumn who has not seen its colors on
      the extreme Old Colony sea-board. There are no mountain ranges, opening
      out far reaches of burning maples; but there are miles of salt-marsh,
      spreading as far as the eye can reach, cut by countless creeks, displaying
      a vast expanse of soft, rich shades of brown; there are cranberry-meadows
      of twenty, thirty, or fifty level acres, covered with matted vines and
      crimson with berries; there are deserted pastures, bright with golden-rod
      and asters. And everywhere along the shores, against the dark pine woods,
      are the varied reds of oaks, of blackberry vines, of woodbine, and of
      sumach.

      It was a bright fall afternoon; most of the boats were in, and lay near,
      shore before the sail-loft door; the sails were up to dry,&mdash;for it
      had been wet outside,&mdash;looking doubly white against the colors of the
      shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sail-loft they were telling stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't think myself,&rdquo; said Deacon Luce, from the rocking-chair,
      &ldquo;that ministers always show what we call horse sense. They used to tell a
      story of Parson Allen, that preached in the Old Town, in my father's time,
      that pleased me. One spring the parson took a notion to raise a pig. So he
      went down to Jim Barrows, that lived there handy by, and says he, 'Mr.
      Barrows, I hear you have a litter of young pigs, and I should like to have
      one to raise.' So Jim he got his stilyards and weighed him out one, and
      the minister paid him, and Jim he sent it up. Well, the minister kep' it
      some three months, and he used to go out every day and put on his
      spectacles and take his scythe down from the apple-tree and mow pig-weed
      for him, and he bought corn-meal to feed him up with, and one way and
      another he laid out a good deal on him. The pig fattened well, but the
      whole incessant time he was either rooting out and gitting into the
      garden, or he'd ketch his foot in behind the trough and squeal like mad,
      or something else, so that the minister had to keep leaving his
      sermon-writing to straighten him out, and the minister's wife complained
      of the squealing when she had company. And so the parson decided to heave
      the enterprise up, and Jim sent up and took the pig back. Come to settle,
      'How do we stand?' says the minister. 'Oh, just as you say,' says Jim,
      'I'll leave it to you.' 'Well,' says the minister, 'on the one hand you've
      got back a pig that you've been paid for; but, on the other hand, I 've
      had the use of him for some three months,&mdash;and so I guess we 're
      square.'&rdquo; &ldquo;Talking of preachers,&rdquo; said Caleb Parker, &ldquo;reminds me of a
      story they tell of Uncle Cephas Bascom, of Northhaven. Uncle Cephas was a
      shoemaker, and he never went to sea much, only to anchor his skift in the
      Narrows abreast of his house, and catch a mess of scup, or to pole a load
      of salt-hay from San-quitt Island. But he used to visit his married
      daughter, in Vermont, and up there they knew he come from the sea-board,
      and they used to call him 'Captain Bascom.' So, one time when he was
      there, they had a Sabbath-school concert, and nothing would do but
      'Captain Bascom' must talk to the boys, and tell a sea-yarn, and draw a
      moral, the way the Deacon, here, does.&rdquo; The Deacon gravely smiled, and
      stroked his beard. &ldquo;Well, Uncle Cephas was ruther pleased with his name of
      'Captain Bascom,' and he did n't like to go back on it, and so he flaxed
      round to git up something. It seems he had heard a summer boarder talk in
      Sabbath-school, at Northhaven; he told how a poor boy minded his mother,
      and then got to tend store, and then kep' store himself, and then he
      jumped it on them. 'That poor boy,' says he, 'now stands before you.' So
      Uncle Cephas thought him up a similar yarn. Well, he had never spoke in
      meeting before, and he hemmed and hawed some, but he got on quite well
      while he was telling about a certain poor boy, and all that, and how the
      boy when he grew up was out at sea, in an open boat, and saw a great
      sword-fish making for the boat Hail Columbia, and bound to stave right
      through her and sink her,&mdash;and how this man he took an oar, and give
      it a swing, and broke the critter's sword square off; and then Uncle
      Cephas&mdash;he 'd begun to git a little flustered&mdash;he stops short,
      and waves his arms, and says he, 'Boys, what do you think! That sword-fish
      now stands before you!' I cal'late that brought the house down.&rdquo; Captain
      Philo, who had laid down his three-cornered sail-needle, to listen to this
      exciting story, readjusted the leather thimble that covered his palm, and
      began to sew again. Uncle Silas, sitting near the water door, in his brown
      overalls made with a breast-apron and suspender-straps, looked out at the
      boats. A silence fell on the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was broken by Calvin Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man was telling me rather a curious story, the other night,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I was just explaining to him exactly how 't was that David Prince lost
      his money, and so he told this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a boy that was clerk in a store, and one day they sent him over
      to the bank to git some money. It was before the war, and the bank gave
      him twenty ten-dollar gold pieces. But when he got back to the store there
      was one short. The boy hadn't nothin' to say. He admitted he had n't
      dropped none, because he 'd put 'em in a leather bag where he could n't
      lose one without he lost all, and the cashier knew <i>he</i> had n't made
      any mistake. The storekeeper he heard the story, and then he put his hand
      on the boy's shoulder, and says he, 'I don't know what to make o' this;
      but I believe this boy,' says he, 'and we 'll just drop it, and say no
      more about it.' So it run along, and the next day that it rained, one of
      the clerks in the store took down an old umberella, and, come to unfurl
      it, out falls a ten-dollar gold piece. Seems that the boy had that
      umberella that day, and hooked it on to the counter in the bank, by the
      handle, and one of the coins must have slid off into it when he was
      countin' 'em, and then he probably did n't spread the umberella coming
      back. And, as this man said that was telling me, it don't do to bet too
      much on suspicion. Now, only for that Jew's being such a hard character,
      according to the newspapers, I should be loath to charge him with taking
      David's money; I should say David might have lost it somewhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobody spoke. Captain Bennett whistled softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never felt so bad in my life,&rdquo; continued Green, &ldquo;as I did when he
      missed his money. When we come up into the depot he was telling me a kind
      of a comical story about old Jim Torrey, how he wanted to find out if all
      his hens was laying, or if any of 'em was disposed to shirk, and he got
      him a pass-book ruled in columns, and opened a ledger account with every
      hen, by a name he give her; and we got up to the ticket-window, and he put
      his hand into his breast-pocket for his wallet&mdash;by George! I 've seen
      him chaff and joke, sort of quiet, when we was going to ride under every
      minute; but he turned as white then as that new mainsail, and off he went,
      like a shot But 't was no use. Of course, the jewelry feller would n't
      disgorge on David's say-so, without no proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was like this,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;the counter was here,&mdash;and David
      stood here,&mdash;and I was here,&mdash;and we both come off together. But
      I tell you,&mdash;the way David looked when he put in his hand for his
      wallet! He stopped laughing, as if he see a ghost; I can't get it out of
      my head. And how the man that stole the money can stand it I can't figure
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he 's calloused,&rdquo; said the Deacon, &ldquo;by what the paper said the
      other night about his buying a parcel of clothes hooked out of some man's
      entry. We concluded 'twas the same man&mdash;by the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't believe all that's in the paper,&rdquo; said Perez Todd; &ldquo;you know the
      paper had me to be married, once; the boys put it in for fun; they made up
      the name for the female, I guess, for I 've been kind of shyin' round for
      her this ten year, and have n't seen no such woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, he's a hard ticket,&rdquo; said Green; &ldquo;that's so, every time. Well,
      I must be going; I agreed to go and help Elbridge over at half flood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half flood about five,&rdquo; said Captain Bennett; &ldquo;you have n't any great
      time to spare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Green went to the shore, rattled a skiff down over the beach to the water,
      and pulled away, with quick, short strokes. First the skiff was cut off
      from sight by the marsh-bank; then the rower's head alone was seen above
      the tall brown grasses; and then he pulled around the bend and was lost to
      view behind a mass of flaming woodbine; and still, in the distance, could
      be heard across the water the rattle of his oars in the thole-pins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Silas?&rdquo; said Captain Bennett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Uncle Silas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I 've nothing to say,&rdquo; said Captain Bennett
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Uncle Silas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calvin's always seemed to be a good-hearted fellow,&rdquo; said Captain Philo,
      &ldquo;since he's lived here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Captain Bennett; &ldquo;seems to feel for David surprisingly.
      Told me all about the losing of the money, told my wife, told my boy, told
      Uncle Joe, told our minister, told the Doctor, told Zimri Cobb, told Cyrus
      Bass, told Captain John Wells, told Patrick Coan; and proves it out to 'em
      all that 't was the Jew that did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of zealous, like the Apostle Paul supplying the pulpit to the
      Gentiles,&rdquo; said the Deacon; &ldquo;won't let alone of a man, till he gives in 't
      the Hebrew's in the wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I 've nothing to say,&rdquo; said Captain Bennett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, nor I,&rdquo; said Uncle Silas.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the distance, borne on the gentle breeze, a click as even as a
      pulse-beat came faintly over the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may be a good-hearted fellow,&rdquo; said the Deacon, &ldquo;but I don't know as I
      hanker to be the man that's pulling that skiff. But then,&mdash;that may
      be simply and solely because I prefer a hair-cloth rocker to a skiff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delia,&rdquo; said David Prince to his wife, one afternoon, &ldquo;Calvin Green has
      bought four tickets to that stereopticon show that's going to be in the
      West Church to-night, and he gave me two, for you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want his tickets,&rdquo; she replied, ironing away at the sunny window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what's the use of talking that way?&rdquo; said her husband, &ldquo;as much as
      to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my opinion,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said her husband, &ldquo;I think it's a hard way to use a man, just
      because he happened to be by when I lost my money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'll tell you,&rdquo; said Delia, stopping her work; &ldquo;we will go, and all I
      'll say is this&mdash;you see if after the lecture's over he does n't find
      a text in it to talk about our money. Now, you just wait and see&mdash;that's
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; said the lecturer, standing by a great circle of
      light thrown on the wall, behind the pulpit, &ldquo;I have now, with a feeling
      of awe befitting this sacred place, thus given you, in the first part of
      my lecture, a succinct view of the origin, rise, and growth of the globe
      on which, as the poet has justly said, 'we dwell.' I have shown you&mdash;corroborating
      Scripture&mdash;the earth, without form and void, the awful monsters of
      the Silurian age, and Man in the Garden of Eden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I now invite you to journey with me&mdash;as one has said&mdash;'across
      the continent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Travelling has ever been viewed as a means of education. Thus Athenian
      sages sought the learning of the Orient. Thus may we this evening, without
      toil or peril, or expense beyond the fifteen cents already incurred for
      the admission-fee, journey in spirit from the wild Atlantic to the sunset
      coast. In the words of the sacred lyrist, Edgar A. Poe, 'My country, 't is
      of thee,' that I shall now display some views.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we start from Boston. On the way to New York, we will first
      pause to view the scene where Putnam galloped down a flight of steps,
      beneath the hostile fire. See both mane and coat-tails flying in the wind,
      and the eyes of steed and rider wildly dilated with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next we pause in Brooklyn. And from my immense variety of scenes in the
      City of Churches, I choose the firemen's monument in Greenwood Cemetery.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'Here they lie low who raised their ladders high;
     Here they still live,&mdash;for heroes cannot die!'
</pre>
    <p>
      [A voice: &ldquo;How many are buried there?&rdquo;]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say, at a venture, eighteen. [A rustle of sympathy among the
      women.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passing on, and coming thence to the metropolis of New York, I am greatly
      embarrassed, so vast is the richness and variety of views. But I will show
      first the 'Five Points.' [Great eagerness, and cries, &ldquo;Down front!&rdquo;] Of
      late, philanthropy and religion, walking in sweet converse, hand in hand,
      have relieved the horrors of this region, and now one may walk there
      comparatively safe. [Sudden cessation of interest]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give even another view of the metropolis: a charming scene in
      Central Park. [Here wavered dimly on the screen five bushes, and a
      nursery-maid with a baby-carriage.] From this exquisite picture you may
      gain some faint idea of the charms of that Paradise raised by the wand of
      taste and skill in a waste of arid sands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passing westward, I next present the Suspension Bridge at Niagara,
      erected by drawing over the majestic stream a cord, a small rope, then a
      wire, until the whole vast framework was complete. The idea was taken from
      the spider's web. Thus the humblest may guide the highest; and I love to
      recall, in this connection, that the lamented Lincoln, some years before
      signing the Emancipation Proclamation, heard me lecture on slavery, in
      Peoria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next we come to Cleveland; and our attention is seized by three cannons
      taken in the famous naval battle on the lake. Every visitor pauses here,
      and with uncovered head and eyes suffused with tears recalls the
      sacrifices of the Fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next we view Chicago the morning after the fire; on every hand are
      blackened ruins,&mdash;painful proofs of the vicissitudes of human
      fortune! [A voice: &ldquo;I was there at the time.&rdquo;] I am delighted to know it
      Such spontaneous corroboration from the audience is to the lecturer's
      heart as a draught from the well of Baca. [Laughter, and a voice: &ldquo;What
      Baker?&rdquo;]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, in order to cross so broad a continent, we must not dally, and next
      I show you the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City, the seat of a defiant
      system of sin. All things, however, have their uses, and I can recommend
      this religion to any young lady present who does not find it easy to
      secure a helpmeet. [Appreciative laughter.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, for a view of the Pacific States, I choose two of the famed Big
      Trees. Judge of them by the two men who stand, like the Widow's mites,
      beside them. These trees are called 'Father and Daughter.' [A voice:
      &ldquo;Which is Father, and which is Daughter?&rdquo;] I am not informed, but from
      their appearance I judge that the nearer is the Father. [Derisive
      laughter.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now we approach a climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the Ten Thousand, in their storied march, reached at last the blue
      waters of the Euxine, thrilled with joy they loudly cried: 'The Sea! The
      Sea!' So we, travellers likewise, reach at last the Western Ocean; and for
      a striking scene upon its waters, I present a Pacific Mail steamer at her
      dock in the harbor of San Francisco. In the left foreground is a Chinese
      laundry. And now I can hardly restrain myself from passing on to Asia; for
      imagination, taking fire, beckons to Niphon and the Flowery Kingdom. But
      remorseless Time says no, and we pause at the Golden Gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In closing, now, I will, as is usual, give one or two moral views,
      relieved by others of a somewhat playful character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First is Napoleon's grave. He who held Europe struggling in his hand,
      died a prisoner in solitudes remote, far from home endearments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next you see Daniel Lambert, whose greatness was of a more solid cast.
      Less grasping in his pretensions than Napoleon, he lived an honored life,
      and died, I understand, among his relatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next is a picture of the guillotine, calling up thoughts of severed heads
      from memory's cloisters. On the left you see a ghastly head; on the right
      the decapitated trunk. By the victim stand the bloody actors in the
      tragedy. Ladies and gentlemen! When I review the awful guilt of Marat and
      Robespierre, humbly do I give thanks that I have been kept from yielding,
      like them, to fierce ambition and lust of power, and that I can lay my
      head upon a peaceful pillow at my home in Fall River.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next is the Serenade. Part one: The Spanish lover with bow-knot shoes,
      pointed hat, and mantle over shoulder, stands, with his lute, on the
      covered water-butt, while at the casement above is his lady's charming
      face. Part two: The head of the water-butt has given way, and the angry
      father, from his window, beholds a scene of luckless misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I turn now to a more pleasing view,&mdash;the Village Blacksmith. The
      mighty man is at his work, and by a triumph of art I am enabled to show
      his fine physique in action: now you see his arm uplifted,&mdash;and now
      the hammer is on the iron. Up&mdash;down&mdash;up&mdash;down. [A voice:
      &ldquo;There are two right arms!&rdquo;] That arises from some slight defect in the
      arrangement of the light; the uplifted arm does not entirely vanish when
      the lowered arm appears. But to the thoughtful observer, such slight
      contrasts only heighten enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen! A single word in closing. Our transcontinental
      journey this evening ended at the Golden Gate. When life's journey ends,
      may we not so pause, but, as the poet Judson Backus sweetly sings:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          'May we find an angel wait
     To lead us through the &ldquo;golden gate.&rdquo;'

      &ldquo;Meanwhile, adieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      David Prince and his wife walked slowly home in the clear, cold moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you notice,&rdquo; said Delia, &ldquo;how the man kept saying that he didn't know
      just what to pick out, to show? Well, I heard the Kelley boy, that helped
      at the lamps, say that they showed every identical picture there was. I
      suppose they are a lot of odds and ends he picked up at an auction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he was a kind of a humbug,&rdquo; said Calvin Green, who, with his
      wife, had come up close behind. &ldquo;See how he kept dragging in his morals,
      jes like overhauling a trawl and taking off a haddock, every once in so
      often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What away to travel,&rdquo; said his wife; &ldquo;to go ker-jump from New York City
      to Niagara, and from there to Cleveland. He must have thought we had long
      stilts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pictures were rather here and there and everywhere, to be sure,&rdquo;,
      said David; &ldquo;but I have a good deal of charity for these men; I s'pose
      they 're put to it for bread and butter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know,&rdquo; said Green; &ldquo;I don't think it has a good influence
      on young people to show such a picture as that man that they murdered by
      slicing his head off with that machine. I don't like such things to be
      brought up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think the opposite,&rdquo; said his wife, laughing, &ldquo;by the way you
      've told every man in town about David's money, and the way he blanched
      when he missed it. I think you 'd better take a lesson yourself about
      bringing up dreadful things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached Green's house, a low, black cottage, they stopped a
      moment for the women to finish a discussion about croup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did that look to you now, David?&rdquo; said Green. &ldquo;Did n't you think it
      would have been a good deal better to have left that picture out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which one?&rdquo; said David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the one where they'd chopped the man's head off with that machine,
      and were standing by, looking at the corpse. I don't like to see such
      things, for my part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said David. &ldquo;I did n't think about it particularly. I
      understood it was in the French Revolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, see all that flummer-diddle he got off about it,&rdquo; said Green; &ldquo;just
      as if any fool did n't know that a man could n't sleep that was haunted by
      a thing like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, some can stomach anything, and I suppose some can sleep on
      anything,&rdquo; said David. &ldquo;I guess it would take more than slicing one man's
      head off to make that Jew lie awake nights. If he 'd only admitted that I
      'd been there! But as soon as I said I 'd left something, then for him and
      his wife to claim they never saw me! They 're cool ones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, right here,&mdash;about what my wife flung out,&rdquo; said Green,
      glancing over his shoulder to where the women were talking, both at once,
      woman-fashion; &ldquo;you know my wife's way,&mdash;you haven't ever heard any
      such talk going round, have you, as that I was hounding folks about your
      bad luck? I say an honest man speaks right out,&mdash;no fear, no favor.
      Ain't that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      It was a bitterly cold, clear night, a few weeks later. Runners squeaked
      and boot-heels crunched in the road. David had passed Green's house at
      seven o'clock, going to the store; he always went by there at that time,
      Saturdays, and passed again, returning home, at about eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the gate, on his return, Green was standing there,
      apparently waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into the house a minute, David,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I want to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led him into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife's gone over to Aunt Nathan's for the evening,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shut the door, and locked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I can't stand it any longer;&rdquo; and he laid upon a table
      at David's side a wallet. David took it up and opened it; it held a great
      roll of bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;why&mdash;this is mine! You don't mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean I stole it,&rdquo; said Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      David sat down. &ldquo;I wish you had put it in the fire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and never
      told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There 's just one thing I want to say,&rdquo; said Green. &ldquo;I picked it up,
      first, to give it to you, and when I saw that you 'd forgot it, I thought
      I 'd have a little joke on you for a while; and then, when I saw how
      things was going, I kind o' drifted into keeping it. You know how I come
      home,&mdash;all my voyage eat up, and a hundred dollars' debts besides,
      and children sick. But every dollar 's there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what I ask,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;is four days' time to ship and get away.
      What are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said David; &ldquo;settle your debts and pay me when you can.&rdquo; And
      taking five twenty-dollar bills from the wallet, he left them on the table
      and went away.
